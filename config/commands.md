## §5 Slash Commands

**Primary namespaces:** `/brief`, `/work`, `/items`, `/goals`, `/domain`, `/content`, `/guide`
**System:** `/health`
**Legacy aliases:** `/catch-up` → `/brief` · `/pr` → `/content` · `/stage` → `/content` ·
`/eval` → `/health quality` · `/cost` → `/health cost` · `/privacy` → `/health privacy` · `/diff` → `/health changes`

---

### `/brief` (primary) — Briefing Command

Full catch-up pipeline. Format determined by Step 2b logic (default: `headline` for 4–48h gaps).
Equivalent natural language: "catch me up", "morning briefing", "SITREP", "what did I miss".

Sub-commands:
- `/brief flash` — force flash format (§8.8) regardless of gap
- `/brief deep` — extended briefing with trend analysis, coaching, scenarios
- `/brief standard` — force full §8.1 standard format (alias: "show everything")
- `/brief digest` — force digest format (§8.7)

### `/catch-up` (legacy alias for `/brief`)
Same as `/brief`. All sub-commands still work: `/catch-up flash`, `/catch-up deep`, `/catch-up standard`.

---

### `/guide` — Contextual Command Discovery

Show what Artha can do right now, adapted to current state, time of day, and recent activity.
No state files loaded — generated from always-available metadata (last catch-up time, item counts, goal count).

Display format:
```

### `/status`
Quick health check — no email fetch. Display:
```
━━ ARTHA STATUS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Last catch-up:  [N] hrs ago ([time])
Active alerts:  [N 🔴] [N 🟠] [N 🟡]
Domain freshness: [table — domain + last update + staleness]
MCP Tools:  Gmail [✅/❌]  Calendar [✅/❌]
CLIs:       Gemini [✅/❌]   Copilot [✅/❌]

```
Read from `health-check.md` and test MCP/CLI connectivity.

### `/goals`
Goal scorecard only — no email fetch. Read `state/goals.md` (personal only) or both personal + work files with `--scope all` (tags work goals `[work]`). Display:
```
━━ GOAL PULSE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[goal bar: NAME  ████████░░ 80%  ON TRACK]
[goal bar: NAME  ████░░░░░░ 40%  AT RISK ]
```
Goal columns: Type | Next Action (overdue marker) | Staleness (days since last_progress) | Progress (metric bar for outcome goals).
Show 2-week trend if available.

**Sprint display (if any sprint is active):**
```
━━ GOAL SPRINTS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[SPRINT NAME]  ██████░░░░  60%  Day 18/30
  Goal: [linked goal] | Target: [description] | ⚡ Pace: [on track|behind|ahead]
  [Calibration note if at 2-week mark: "Calibration pending — pace review?"]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```
**Sprint commands:**
- `/goals sprint new` — create a new sprint (Artha asks: name, linked goal, target, duration 14–90 days; default 30 days)
- `/goals sprint pause [name]` — pause sprint progress tracking
- `/goals sprint close [name]` — mark sprint complete; log outcome to memory.md

### `/domain <name>`
Deep-dive into a single domain. Read `state/<name>.md` and `prompts/<name>.md`. Display:
- Last updated timestamp
- All active items (not archived) with status
- Any open alerts for this domain
- Suggested next action (if any)
Valid domain names: immigration, finance, kids, travel, health, home, shopping, goals, calendar, vehicle, estate, insurance, comms

### `/domains`
List all available domains with enable/disable status and a one-line description.

**Display format:**
```
━━ YOUR DOMAINS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ALWAYS ACTIVE (load every catch-up):
  ✅ finance       — Bills, bank accounts, credit cards, investments
  ✅ immigration   — USCIS filings, visa status, passport, travel docs
  ✅ health        — Doctor appointments, prescriptions, insurance
  ✅ calendar      — Appointments, reminders, events, schedules
  ✅ comms         — Important messages, follow-ups
  ✅ goals         — Personal goals, habit tracking, progress

ENABLED (load when relevant emails received):
  ✅ home          — Mortgage/rent, maintenance, utilities
  ✅ employment    — Payroll, HR, benefits
  ...

DISABLED (not active — enable with /domains enable <name>):
  ⬜ kids          — School events, homework, grades
  ⬜ pets          — [household_types: not applicable] Pet health, vaccinations
  ...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
N enabled · M disabled · Run a catch-up after enabling to load domain data.
```

**Sub-commands:**
- `/domains enable <name>` — enable a domain (calls `toggle_domain(name, enabled=True)` in profile_loader.py)
- `/domains disable <name>` — disable a domain (calls `toggle_domain(name, enabled=False)`)
- `/domains info <name>` — show full domain details (sensitivity, required connectors, setup questions)

**Implementation:**
Read domain list from `config/domain_registry.yaml` via `scripts/profile_loader.py::available_domains()`.
Cross-reference with `config/user_profile.yaml::domains` to determine enabled/disabled state.
Filter out `phase_2` domains (show as "Coming soon" in a separate section only if the user explicitly asks).
For `enable` / `disable` sub-commands: call `profile_loader.toggle_domain()`, then confirm change.



### `/cost` (legacy alias → `/health cost`)
Shows monthly API cost. Now a section within `/health`. Still works as standalone shortcut.

### `/lint` — Data Health Audit (KB-LINT)

Run a cross-domain data quality audit across all state files in `state/*.md`.
Equivalent natural language: "lint", "check data", "audit data", "data health", "how fresh is my data".

**Usage:**
```
/lint                        — full lint (P1–P6 passes) across all domains
/lint finance                — lint a single domain
/lint --fix                  — lint + interactively apply fixable issues
/lint --brief                — one-line summary only (used by briefing hook)
/lint --init                 — add frontmatter skeletons to files missing ---
/lint --json                 — machine-readable JSON output
```

**Passes:**
| Pass | Name | Severity | Enabled by default |
|------|------|----------|--------------------|
| P1 | Schema validation (schema_version, last_updated, sensitivity) | ERROR | ✅ yes |
| P2 | Staleness TTL check (per-domain or sensitivity-fallback) | WARNING | ✅ yes |
| P3 | TODO / TBD / PLACEHOLDER audit (full file body + frontmatter) | WARNING | ✅ yes |
| P4 | Past-date action items (appointment, deadline, renewal, etc.) | WARNING | opt-in |
| P5 | Cross-domain reference integrity (from `config/lint_rules.yaml`) | WARNING | opt-in |
| P6 | open_items.md referencing unknown domains | WARNING | opt-in |

All passes with `--passes P1,P2,P3,P4,P5,P6` to run them all.

**Bootstrap mode:** If ≥50% of files lack frontmatter, individual P1 errors are suppressed and
the tool suggests `--init` instead of listing every file.

**Sample output:**
```

```

**Implementation:** `scripts/kb_lint.py` — thin CLI over shared Artha primitives.
Writes `state/lint_summary.yaml` after each full run for observability.

---

### `/health` — System Health (consolidated)
Single "is everything OK?" command. Consolidates system integrity, evaluation quality, domain
freshness, cost, and privacy into one view.

```
━━ ARTHA SYSTEM HEALTH ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

```

Scoped views:
- `/health connections` → connections section only
- `/health quality` → quality metrics (was `/eval`)
- `/health cost` → cost section (was `/cost`)
- `/health privacy` → full privacy disclosure (was `/privacy`)
- `/health changes` → state changes (was `/diff`)
- `/health reconnect <service>` → guided OAuth re-auth for a named service

### `/eval` (legacy alias → `/health quality`)
Still works. `/eval`, `/eval perf`, `/eval accuracy`, `/eval freshness` all route to the
appropriate `/health` sub-section. `/eval skills` remains independent (runs `eval_runner.py --skills`).

### `/eval skills`
Run `python3 scripts/eval_runner.py --skills`. Reads `state/skills_cache.json` and renders
the Skill Health table: classification (broken / degraded / stable / healthy / warming_up),
success rate, zero-value rate, last value timestamp, wall-clock timing, and cadence status
(with reduction suggestion if consecutive_zero ≥ 10). Broken and degraded skills sort to
the top. Use this to decide whether to disable or cadence-reduce a skill via R7.

### `/eval effectiveness`
Claude-rendered summary (no Python required). Steps:
1. Read `state/catch_up_runs.yaml` (last 10 entries)
2. Read `state/skills_cache.json` — count broken and degraded skills
3. Render the Effectiveness table and trend narrative:

```markdown
## Artha Effectiveness — Last 10 Catch-ups

| Date | Format | Engagement | User OIs | Corrections | Items Surfaced | Skills Broken |
|------|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| 3/27 | std    | 0.33      | 1        | 0           | 3              | 2             |

**Trends:**
- Mean engagement rate: 0.33 (target: 0.25–0.50) ✅
- R2 compression: NOT ACTIVE (need N more runs with engagement_rate)

**Recommendations:**
- [list any broken/degraded/stable skills with suggestions]
```

Note: entries where `engagement_rate` is `null` (no alerts generated that session) are
displayed as `—` in the Engagement column and excluded from the mean calculation.

### `/items`
Display all open action items from `state/open_items.md`. Groups:
```
━━ OPEN ITEMS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔴 OVERDUE (deadline passed)
  OI-NNN [domain] [description] — due [date] ([N days overdue])

🟠 DUE SOON (≤7 days)
  OI-NNN [domain] [description] — due [date]

🟡 UPCOMING
  OI-NNN [domain] [description] — due [date]

🔵 OPEN (no deadline)
  OI-NNN [domain] [description]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[N] open items · [N] synced to Microsoft To Do
```
Also accepts: `/items add [description]` to interactively add a new item (Artha asks: domain, deadline, priority, then appends to `open_items.md` and pushes to To Do if configured).

Markdown: `/items done OI-NNN` marks item done; `/items defer OI-NNN [days]` defers.

> **DC-5 Anti-Sycophancy:** Closing a Work Open Item (WOI) requires a resolution context. If no WorkIQ signal corroborates the close, Artha will prompt: *"No WorkIQ confirmation found. Marking [user-confirmed] only. Close with unverified flag, or search for confirmation?"* This prompt cannot be suppressed — it fires whenever `confidence < [live]`.

### `/items quick`
Show only the 5-Minute task list from `state/memory.md → quick_tasks`. Quick display:
```
━━ ⚡ QUICK TASKS (≤5 min, phone-ready) ━━
• [QT-001] [domain] [description]
• [QT-002] [domain] [description]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[N] quick tasks · updated [time]
```
If `quick_tasks` is empty or not yet populated: "No quick tasks identified — run a catch-up to detect them."

---

### `/undo [domain]` — Restore Previous State (AFW-6)

Roll back the most recent state write for a domain using the pre-write snapshot stored in
`tmp/state_snapshots/`. Snapshots are taken automatically by `WriteGuardMiddleware` before
every state file write.

**Natural language triggers:** "undo", "undo the finance update", "roll back that health
change", "revert the last write to immigration".

**Usage:**
- `/undo` — undo the most recent write across all domains (shows a menu if multiple candidates)
- `/undo <domain>` — undo the most recent write to the named domain (e.g. `/undo finance`)

**Undo flow:**
```
"undo the finance update"
└── Find latest snapshot: tmp/state_snapshots/finance_<YYYYMMDDTHHmmss>.snap
└── Restore snapshot content → state/finance.md (atomic write)
└── Append to state/audit.md: "UNDO: finance restored to <timestamp>"
└── Confirm: "✅ Restored finance state to <timestamp> (N chars)"
```

**When no snapshot exists:**
```
⚠ No snapshot found for domain 'finance'.
  Snapshots are created before every write. If no snapshot exists, the domain
  has not been modified this session or the snapshot expired (>24h retention).
```

**Snapshot retention:** Last 5 snapshots per domain; auto-pruned after 24 hours.
Snapshots are stored in `tmp/state_snapshots/` (gitignored — never committed).

**Safety constraints:**
- Only restores `state/*.md` files — never `tmp/`, `config/`, or vault files.
- Encrypted files (`*.md.age`) are snapshotted in their encrypted form; restoration
  writes back the encrypted bytes.
- `/undo` MUST NOT restore a pre-correction state (a snapshot taken before a Step 19
  user correction was applied). When a correction is applied, existing snapshots for
  that domain are superseded.

**Implementation:** `scripts/lib/state_snapshot.restore_latest()` + `scripts/lib/state_writer.write_atomic()`.

---

### `/bootstrap` and `/bootstrap <domain>`
Guided interview to systematically populate state files. Replaces empty/bootstrap placeholder data with real user-provided information.

**Usage:**
- `/bootstrap` — show all domains with population status, then select one to populate
- `/bootstrap <domain>` — jump directly to that domain's interview
- `/bootstrap quick` — rapid setup mode: collect only the 3–5 highest-priority fields per domain
- `/bootstrap validate` — re-run validation on all existing state files; report field gaps, format errors, and stale data without modifying anything
- `/bootstrap integration` — guided setup for a new data integration (Gmail, Calendar, Outlook, iCloud)

**Workflow:**
```
1. If no domain specified, display population status table:
   ━━ BOOTSTRAP STATUS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Domain          Status           Action
   immigration     ⚠ placeholder    /bootstrap immigration
   finance         ⚠ placeholder    /bootstrap finance
   kids            ✅ populated     —
   health          ⚠ placeholder    /bootstrap health
   ...
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. For selected domain:
   a. Read state file schema from prompts/<domain>.md
   b. Derive interview questions from schema fields
   c. Ask ONE question at a time — never dump a form
   d. Validate input:
      - Dates: must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
      - Amounts: must be numeric
      - Required enum fields: offer valid options
   e. For sensitive fields (SSN, case numbers, account numbers):
      "This field is stored encrypted at rest. Enter your value:"
      Apply Layer 2 semantic redaction before writing
   f. After each domain section, confirm:
      "Here's what I'll save for [section]. Correct? [yes / edit / skip]"

3. Progress tracking:
   - Save progress per domain in memory.md → context_carryover
   - User can exit mid-interview: "Saved progress — resume with /bootstrap <domain>"
   - Already-answered fields preserved on resume

4. After writing:
   a. Run Layer 2 post-write verification (Step 8c)
   b. Update frontmatter: updated_by: user_interview (replaces 'bootstrap')
   c. Update last_updated timestamp
   d. Show completion summary:
      "✅ [domain].md populated: [N] fields written, verification passed"
   e. If domain is encrypted: vault.py decrypt → write → verify → vault.py encrypt

5. Detection rules for population status:
   - `updated_by: bootstrap` → ⚠ placeholder
   - `updated_by: user_interview` or `updated_by: artha-catchup` with >5 populated fields → ✅ populated
   - File missing → ❌ missing
```

**`/bootstrap quick` — Rapid setup mode:**
```
Ask only the 3–5 highest-priority fields per domain (marked `priority: high` in each prompt schema).
Skip optional / enrichment fields entirely.
Suitable for first-run users who want to get started in under 10 minutes.
After completing all high-priority fields, summarize:
  "✅ Quick setup complete. You can deepen any domain with /bootstrap <domain>."
```

**`/bootstrap validate` — Validation-only mode:**
```
For each populated state file:
  1. Check required fields are present and non-empty
  2. Validate date formats (ISO 8601)
  3. Validate numeric fields (no units embedded in numeric values)
  4. Check for stale data (last_updated older than 180 days)
  5. Scan for residual bootstrap placeholders (e.g. "[TBD]", "placeholder")
  6. Run PII guard sanity check (no raw PII in encrypted-at-rest fields)
Output a report card — do NOT modify any files.
  ━━ VALIDATION REPORT ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Domain         Result   Issues
  immigration    ✅ OK    —
  finance        ⚠ stale  last_updated 210 days ago
  health         ❌ gaps  3 required fields missing
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**`/bootstrap integration` — Add a new data integration:**
```
Present a menu of available integrations:
  1. Gmail / Google Calendar  (setup_google_oauth.py)
  2. Outlook / Microsoft To Do / Teams  (setup_msgraph_oauth.py)
  3. iCloud Mail / Calendar  (setup_icloud_auth.py)
  4. Canvas LMS  (canvas_fetch.py)
  5. Apple Health  (parse_apple_health.py)
Guide user through the selected setup script with step-by-step prompts.
After completion, run the corresponding --health check and report status.
```

### `/dashboard`

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### `/decisions`
View active decision log. Read `state/decisions.md`. Display all active decisions with ID, summary, and review trigger.
Optional: `/decisions DEC-NNN` for full detail of one decision.
Optional: `/decisions add` to interactively log a new decision (Artha asks for context, domains, alternatives).

### `/scenarios`
View and run scenario analyses. Read `state/scenarios.md`. Display:
```
━━ SCENARIO ENGINE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WATCHING (not triggered):
  SCN-001: Mortgage Refinance — trigger: rate < 6.0%
  SCN-002: Job Change Impact — trigger: mention of job transition
  SCN-003: College Cost Planning — trigger: SAT score / annual
  SCN-004: Immigration Timeline — trigger: PD movement / EAD risk
  SCN-005: Emergency Fund Stress Test — trigger: finance review

ACTIVE (triggered this session): [if any]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```
`/scenarios SCN-NNN` runs a specific scenario analysis with current state data.

### `/goals leading`
Goal scorecard with leading indicators. Read `state/goals.md` + leading indicator data from domain prompts. Display:
```
━━ GOAL PULSE + LEADING INDICATORS ━━━━━━━━

[GOAL NAME]  ████░░░░░░  40%  AT RISK
  Leading: [indicator]: [value]  ⚠️ [alert if triggered]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### `/diff [period]` (legacy alias → `/health changes`)
Still works. Show meaningful state changes over a period. Uses git history of the `state/` directory.
- `/diff` → changes since last catch-up (default)
- `/diff 7d` → changes in last 7 days
- `/diff 30d` → changes in last 30 days
- `/diff DEC-NNN` → changes since a specific decision was logged

**Implementation:**
```bash
git log --since="[period]" --name-only --format="" -- state/*.md \
  | sort -u \
  | while read f; do git diff HEAD~N -- "$f"; done
```
Summarize each changed file as:
```
state/immigration.md  [+N/-N lines]
  + Added: [brief description of additions]
  - Removed: [brief description of removals]
```
Filter out `last_updated:` timestamp changes as noise. Show only semantic content changes.
If git history not available: "No git history found — run `git init && git add state/ && git commit -m 'Artha baseline'` to enable /diff."

### `/privacy` (legacy alias → `/health privacy`)
Still works. Show the current privacy surface. Display:
```
━━ PRIVACY SURFACE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Encrypted at rest (age):
  ✅ immigration.md · finance.md · health.md · insurance.md
  ✅ estate.md · audit.md · vehicle.md · contacts.md

PII filtering accuracy (last 30 days):
  Scanned: [N] emails | Redactions applied: [N] | Patterns caught: [N]
  False positive rate: [N]% | False negative rate: estimated [N]%

Data flows to external services:
  Claude API:   email bodies + state excerpts (PII pre-filtered)
  Gemini CLI:   web research queries only (via safe_cli.py, PII scanned)
  Copilot CLI:  code queries only (via safe_cli.py, PII scanned)
  MS To Do:     open item descriptions (no PII policy: never store PII in titles)
  Gmail:        briefing emails to self only (sensitivity-filtered for sensitive domains)
  OneDrive:     encrypted state files at rest

Last encryption cycle: [timestamp from vault.py status]
Vault lock state: [locked|unlocked]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```
Read PII stats from `health-check.md → pii_footer` (aggregated over rolling 30 days). Read vault state from `vault.py status`.

### `/teach [topic]`
Domain-aware explanation using the user's own data as context. `[topic]` can be a concept, acronym, or question.

**Examples:**
- `/teach EAD` → explains Employment Authorization Document using current immigration state
- `/teach priority date` → explains USCIS Visa Bulletin priority dates using actual PD from immigration.md
- `/teach EB-2 NIW` → explains National Interest Waiver with case context from state files
- `/teach compound interest` → explains with reference to actual account values from finance.md

**Format:**
```
━━ TEACH: [topic] ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2–4 paragraph explanation in plain English]
[What this means for YOUR situation (using state file data):]
  • [Specific implication 1]
  • [Specific implication 2]
[Related: [linked concept if relevant]]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```
If topic is immigration-related, load `state/immigration.md` for context (even if encrypted — decrypt first).
If topic is finance-related, load `state/finance.md`.
If topic not recognized: "I don't have specific state data for '[topic]' but here's a general explanation: [...]"

### `/power`
**Power Half Hour** — focused 30-minute session. Artha becomes a rapid-fire action assistant:
1. Lists all open items due ≤7 days (ordered by U×I×A score)
1.5. **Goal Check:** Surface any active goals where `next_action_date` is today or past, OR where `last_progress` > 14 days. Max 2 lines. Example: "⚡ G-002 next action overdue (weigh in was due Saturday). G-003 still parked 30d." If all goals are healthy, skip silently (UX-1).
2. Presents each item with FNA annotation
3. For each item: "Done / Defer / Escalate / Skip?"
4. Executes approved actions (email draft, calendar event) with minimal friction
5. At completion: "Power Hour complete — [N] items resolved, [N] deferred"
Log session to `state/audit.md` as `POWER_HOUR | [timestamp] | items_handled: [N]`

### `/content` — Content Namespace (replaces `/pr` and `/stage`)

> **Requires:** `enhancements.pr_manager: true` (activate via `/bootstrap pr_manager`)
> **State files:** `state/pr_manager.md`, `state/gallery.yaml`

**`/content`** or **`/content calendar`** — Content calendar view with moment scores and quota.
Shows scored moments, thread status, posts-this-week quota.
Run: `python3 scripts/pr_manager.py --view`
```
━━ 📣 CONTENT CALENDAR ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Moment                     Platforms       Thread   Score
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🟠 [Occasion] (date)      LI + FB + WA    NT-2     0.92
🟡 [Topic]               LinkedIn        NT-5     0.68
Posts this week: 0/2 (LinkedIn) · 0/2 (FB) · 0/2 (IG)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**`/content threads`** — Narrative thread progress: last post, cadence, reception trend per thread.
Run: `python3 scripts/pr_manager.py --threads`

**`/content voice`** — Display active voice profile: tone, language, AVOID list, signature elements.
Run: `python3 scripts/pr_manager.py --voice`

**`/content history [year]`** — Post history. Read `state/pr_manager.md → Post History`.

**`/content draft <platform> [topic]`** — Create a draft for `<platform>`. Topic is optional.
> Requires: `enhancements.pr_manager.compose: true`

Platform shorthands: `li` → `linkedin`, `fb` → `facebook`, `ig` → `instagram`, `wa` → `whatsapp_status`

1. Run: `python3 scripts/pr_manager.py --draft-context <platform>` → get JSON context
2. Generate 1 clean variant in-context
3. Apply 3-gate PII firewall (context sanitization + pii_guard.py + human review)
4. On approval: `python3 scripts/pr_manager.py --log-post <platform> "<topic>" <thread_id> <score>`

**`/content cards`** — List active cards by status (seed/drafting/staged/approved).
Load `state/gallery.yaml`, filter `status ∈ {seed, drafting, staged, approved}`.

**`/content preview <topic>`** — Show full card. Fuzzy-matches topic in card title or subject.
Display: occasion, event date, status, platform drafts, PII flags.

**`/content approve <topic>`** — Mark card approved; emit copy-ready content per platform.
Fuzzy-matches topic. If multiple match → ask for disambiguation.

**`/content expand <topic>`** — Generate full draft for an existing seeded card.
If no card found: "No card found for that topic — say `/content draft [platform] [topic]` to create one."

**`/content posted <topic> <platform>`** — Log post as published; update platform draft status.

**`/content dismiss <topic>`** — Archive card without posting. Moves to `dismissed` status.

**`/content archive [year]`** — Browse historical gallery from `state/gallery_memory.yaml`.

**Fuzzy matching:** When topic is provided, search `state/gallery.yaml` for topic in card title or
subject. Single match → proceed. Zero or multiple → ask for disambiguation. Machine IDs
(e.g., `CARD-SEED-HOLI-2026`) still work for precision.

**Legacy aliases (all still work):**
- `/pr` → `/content calendar`
- `/pr threads` → `/content threads`
- `/pr voice` → `/content voice`
- `/pr history` → `/content history`
- `/pr draft <platform>` → `/content draft <platform>`
- `/pr moments` → `/content calendar` (moments view)
- `/stage` → `/content cards`
- `/stage preview <ID>` → `/content preview <topic>`
- `/stage approve <ID>` → `/content approve <topic>` (ID still works for precision)
- `/stage draft <ID>` → `/content expand <topic>`
- `/stage posted <ID> <platform>` → `/content posted <topic> <platform>`
- `/stage dismiss <ID>` → `/content dismiss <topic>`
- `/stage history [year]` → `/content archive [year]`

### `/radar` — AI Trend Radar (PR-3)

> **State file:** `state/ai_trend_radar.md`
> **Signal output:** `tmp/ai_trend_signals.json`

**`/radar`** — Display current AI trend signals.
1. Read `tmp/ai_trend_signals.json`.
2. If file absent or `signal_count == 0`: run `/radar run` inline to pull fresh signals first.
3. Otherwise display in table format:
```

```
4. Flag any signal where `try_worthy: true` with a `⚡ TRY` badge.
5. Show current topics from `state/ai_trend_radar.md → topics_of_interest`.

**`/radar topic list`** — Show all topics in the Interest Graph (from `state/ai_trend_radar.md → topics_of_interest`).

**`/radar topic add <name>`** — Add a new topic to the Interest Graph.
1. Prompt for keywords (comma-separated) if not provided.
2. Append to `state/ai_trend_radar.md → topics_of_interest` with today's date, `boost: 0.3`, `source: manual`.
3. Confirm: "Added topic '<name>' to radar Interest Graph."

**`/radar topic remove <name>`** — Remove a topic from the Interest Graph.
1. Find entry in `state/ai_trend_radar.md → topics_of_interest` matching the name (case-insensitive).
2. Remove and confirm: "Removed topic '<name>' from radar Interest Graph."

**`/radar run`** — Pull fresh signals (calls `artha_run_skills("ai_trend_radar")` via MCP if available, or instructs user to run `python3 -c "from pathlib import Path; from scripts.skills.ai_trend_radar import get_skill; get_skill(Path('.')).pull()"`).

# ── Work OS Commands ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Namespace: /work
# Surface: work domains only (state/work/*), never personal state
# Bridge reads: state/bridge/personal_schedule_mask.json ONLY
# Implementation: scripts/work_loop.py, scripts/work_reader.py

## `/work` — Full Work Briefing
Reads all work domains. Produces a structured briefing: meeting count, comms needing response, sprint health, boundary score, recommended next move.
- Reads pre-computed state only (§3.8). Never invokes connectors inline.
- Includes data freshness footer: "Last refresh: [timestamp] ([age])".
- If state is older than staleness threshold, emits warning.

## `/work decide <context>` — Decision Support
Reads work-career, work-projects, work-people, work-notes, work-decisions. Phase 3.

## `/work live <meeting-id>` — Live Meeting Assist
Reads work-calendar, work-people, work-notes, work-projects. Phase 2.

## `/work connect-prep` — Connect Cycle Preparation
Reads work-performance, work-career, work-projects, work-people, work-accomplishments. Goal progress, evidence summary, manager pivot log.
- Accomplishment ledger filtered by Connect cycle date range + program + impact level
- OPEN items surfaced as risks/blockers to address before submission
- `--skip` — skip-level optimized narrative
- `--calibration` — third-person calibration defense brief (§7.6)
- `--final` — full rewards season packet
- `--narrative` — impact-framed Connect narrative

## `/work sources [query]` — Data Source Lookup

- `--escalation <context>` — escalation note with options framing (Phase 3)

## `/work talking-points <topic>` — Talking Points
Reads work-calendar, work-projects, work-people, work-performance. Phase 3.

## `/work refresh` — Live Connector Refresh
Executes full Work Operating Loop (§8.5) with live network I/O. Reports per-provider freshness afterward. This is the only command that invokes connectors inline.

## `/work oof <name>` — OOF Coverage Prep (alias: `ooo`)
Prepares Ved to cover for a team member who is Out of Office (OOF).
Reads Team Lead Journal (work-notes.md) + queries WorkIQ for live tactical context.

**Aliases:** `work ooo <name>`, `work cover <name>`, `<name> is OOF — prep me`

**Flow:**
1. **Static context** (instant, from KB + state files):
   - Team Lead Journal entry for the person (open items, meetings to cover, mentoring notes)
   - Their KB entity: works_on edges, expertise signals, OOF backup artifacts
   - Current hot items in their domains (IcMs, blockers)
   - Golden queries for their areas

2. **Live tactical context** (WorkIQ query, ~30s):
   - Recent Teams chats involving the person (last 5 days)
   - Recent emails sent/received by the person (last 5 days)
   - Action items they committed to (from chat/email signals)
   - Decisions made in their area threads

3. **Output** — written to `state/work/oof-coverage-<name>.md` (ephemeral):
   - 📅 Meetings to attend (with times, attendees, purpose)
   - 🔥 Hot items in their areas (IcMs, blockers, deadlines)
   - 💬 Recent chat/email context (action items, commitments, threads)
   - 📊 KQL queries to run for live data in their areas
   - 📝 Mentoring context (relationship notes, growth areas)
   - 🔄 When they return: what to hand back

4. **Cleanup:** OOF coverage file is auto-deleted when user says `<name> is back` or
   after 14 days (prevents stale OOF context from persisting).

**Data quality:** Live WorkIQ data is accuracy-first — chat/email content is served
with source attribution (sender, date, thread subject). If WorkIQ is unavailable,
falls back to static context only with caveat: "⚠ No live chat data — run manually
or check Teams directly."

## `/work query <question>` — Golden Query (Kusto Data)
Matches `<question>` to the Golden Query Registry (`state/work/golden-queries.md`).
If a match is found, executes validated KQL via `scripts/kusto_runner.py` and returns
the answer with a **Data Card** showing: query used, source cluster/db, data freshness,
confidence level, caveats. If no match, composes ad-hoc KQL from `work-kusto-catalog.md`.
- `--query-id GQ-NNN` — run a specific golden query by ID
- `--list` — list all registered golden queries
- `--audit` — show confidence breakdown, pending validations, stale queries
- Every response includes a Data Card footer for full transparency
- Requires corpnet/VPN for Kusto cluster access
- Phase: Active (registry-based, extensible)

**Learning behavior:** When an ad-hoc query (not from registry) successfully answers a
question, flag it as a golden query candidate. If the same pattern is used 2+ times,
prompt to formalize it into the registry.

## `/work promo-case` — Promotion Readiness Assessment
Reads work-project-journeys, work-performance, work-people (visibility events), work-career, work-accomplishments. Outputs: promotion thesis (auto-generated from scope arc), evidence density per goal (★1–5), visibility events from L-N+ stakeholders, readiness signal, evidence gaps. The accomplishment ledger provides the exhaustive chronological record of every HIGH/MEDIUM impact item across all programs — the evidence backbone for the promo narrative. Phase 3.

## `/work promo-case --narrative` — Full Promotion Narrative
Generates `state/work/work-promo-narrative.md` — promotion-grade document with thesis, before/after transformation, scope expansion arc, milestone evidence with artifact citations, manager/peer voice, visibility events. Consumes `work-accomplishments.md` ledger as exhaustive evidence source alongside project journeys and career evidence. Human-review draft only — never submitted autonomously. Phase 3.

## `/work journey [project]` — Project Timeline View
Reads work-project-journeys. Shows long-running program timeline: milestones, evidence citations, scope expansion arc, before/after state. `[project]` filters to a single program or shows all. Phase 3.

## `/work products` — Product Knowledge Index
Lists all products in the taxonomy tree with: name, layer (data-plane/control-plane/offering),
status, owning team, and active projects. Reads `state/work/work-products.md`.
- `/work products <name>` — show deep product knowledge file (`state/work/products/<slug>.md`)
- `/work products add <name>` — interactively create a new product entry (index + deep file)
- Trigger-loaded: not fetched on every briefing; loaded when meeting prep or query references a product
- Phase: Active

## `/work code <question>` — Code Search (Bluebird)
Routes code-level questions to Engineering Copilot Mini (Bluebird) MCP for ADO repo search.
Configured repos: Storage-XKulfi, Storage-Armada (msazure/One project).
- `work code <question>` — natural language code search
- `work code <symbol>` — symbol lookup (class, method, function)
- Requires Bluebird MCP server running (`.vscode/mcp.json` → `bluebird`)
- Falls back to golden query catalog if Bluebird is unavailable
- Phase: Active

## `/work remember <text>` — Instant Micro-Capture
Appends `<text>` to `state/work/work-notes.md` with `[quick-capture YYYY-MM-DD]` marker and timestamp. Processed by work-learn on next refresh cycle (fact extraction, keyword linking, org-calendar detection for `org-calendar:` prefix). Input is PII-scanned before write. Phase 2.

## `/work reflect` — Reflection Loop (Multi-Horizon Planning & Review)
Auto-detects which horizon is due (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly) and runs the full
sweep → extract → score → reconcile → synthesize → draft pipeline.

**MANDATORY in LLM context:** Before writing any state, you MUST execute the
WorkIQ data collection protocol in `config/reflect-protocol.md`. This requires
running 4 identity-scoped WorkIQ queries (emails, meetings, ADO items, IcM incidents)
for the exact reflection window. Do NOT skip this step — state file quality depends on it.
- `/work reflect daily` — force daily close
- `/work reflect weekly` — force weekly reflection
- `/work reflect monthly` — force monthly retrospective
- `/work reflect quarterly` — force quarterly review
- `/work reflect --status` — show last close times and which horizons are due
- `/work reflect --audit` — show reflection audit log with sequence numbers
- `/work reflect --compact` — manual compaction trigger (Tier 2 → Tier 3)
- `/work reflect --tune` — interactive scoring calibration (5 pairwise comparisons)
- `/work reflect --backfill` — run historical backfill from work-scrape corpus
- `/work reflect --backfill-review` — interactive validation of backfilled data
- `deep reflect` — **DC-6 Research Mode** (opt-in, explicit only): runs a 4-pass deep investigation (primary signal → corroboration → cross-signal → external context) before any state write. Activates when user says "deep reflect", "reflect --days 30", or asks a causal question ("why did X happen?"). Max 300s. Sufficiency Gate enforces tier minimums: `[signaled]` for new entries, `[live]` for closes. See `config/reflect-protocol.md §DC-6` for full protocol.
- Phase: Active (Sprint 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 1.5 + Sprint 2 complete)

## `/work thrivesync` — Weekly Team Priorities Post
Generates your top-N weekly priorities post for the team ThriveSync ritual (Monday 8 AM).
Reads work-goals, work-projects, work-open-items, work-performance. Synthesizes the highest-impact
items into a crisp, copy-pasteable list for Teams.

**Workflow:**
1. `work thrivesync` — generate draft from current work state (auto-triggered on Monday briefings)
2. Review and edit the draft
3. `work thrivesync approve` — marks as posted, logs to `state/work/work-thrivesync.md`
4. Copy the approved text to Teams

**Sub-commands:**
- `work thrivesync` — generate this week's draft
- `work thrivesync approve` — mark current draft as posted (updates `last_posted`)
- `work thrivesync history` — show last 4 weeks of ThriveSync posts
- `work thrivesync edit <n> <new text>` — replace priority #n with new text before approving

**Configuration:** `user_profile.yaml → work.thrivesync`
- `top_n`: number of priorities (default 5)
- `day`: posting day (default Monday)
- `time`: posting deadline (default 08:00)
- `channel`: where to post (default teams)

**Monday briefing integration:** When `thrivesync_due = true`, the Monday briefing
automatically includes a §8.14 ThriveSync block after the Week Ahead section.
The block contains a ready-to-post draft — no separate command needed unless you
want to regenerate or edit.

**Natural language triggers:** "thrivesync", "weekly priorities", "what should I post",
"my top 5 for the week", "team priorities post"

- Phase: Active

## `/work scope` — Ownership Areas & Next Actions
Reads `state/work/work-scope.md`. Displays all active ownership areas with priority tier,
co-owner, current next action, and LT visibility flag. This is the "full scope dump" that
feeds ThriveSync generation and Connect evidence assembly.

**Display format:**
```
━━ YOUR SCOPE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
P0  XPF Ramp           → Drive P1 to 100%; resolve deployment blockers
P0  DD on PF (Yasser)  → Unblock RDMA regression; confirm pilot date
P1  Armada (Ramjee)    → Define M1 scope doc and timeline
P1  Ops Excellence     → Asgard migration %; SLO delta
P1  xDeployment (Isaiah) → OneDeploy blocker resolution
P1  xSSE (Nikita)      → XPF/DD-PF/Armada execution; BIOS deadline
P2  Rubik (Isaiah)     → Roadmap with Isaiah; milestone plan
P2  Shiproom AI        → Security hardening to go live
P2  xConfig            → Architecture learning for Armada
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
9 areas · Updated [date]
```

**Sub-commands:**
- `work scope` — display all active areas with next actions
- `work scope update <area> <next action>` — update the next action for an area
- `work scope add <area>` — interactively add a new ownership area
- `work scope remove <area>` — archive an area (moves to evolution log)
- `work scope history` — show the area evolution log (additions, removals, priority changes)

**Integration points:**
- **ThriveSync** (§8.14): scope areas are the primary input for weekly priority generation
- **Connect-prep**: scope breadth feeds the "scope expansion arc" evidence
- **Work briefing**: scope areas inform the domain coverage in morning briefings
- **Reflection loop**: weekly reflections reconcile scope vs actual time spent

- Phase: Active

## `/work standup` — Daily Stand-Up Generator (FR-32.4)

Generates a formatted stand-up update from accomplishments and open items. No live queries — reads cached state only. Completes in < 2 seconds.

**Natural language triggers:** "standup", "what's my standup", "generate standup", "daily update", "what did I do yesterday", "what's happening today"

**Input sources (in order):**
1. `state/work/work-accomplishments.md` — entries from last 2 calendar days
2. `state/work/work-open-items.md` — Critical + Active This Week sections
3. `state/work/work-weekly-plan.md` — Focus Outcomes for current week (if file exists)
4. `state/work/reflect-current.md` — active IcMs, Sev-2+ only

**Output format:**
```
━━ STANDUP — [DAY, DATE] ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ DONE
  • [Action verb + outcome] ([program]) — [name-drop if cross-team]
  • [Action verb + outcome] ([program])

⏩ TODAY / TOMORROW
  • [Action verb + planned outcome] ([program]) — [by when if deadline]
  • [Action verb + planned outcome] ([program])

⛔ BLOCKERS (if any)
  • [Blocker description] → waiting on [person/team]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
~[N] words
```

**Format rules:**
- Action verbs first — never start with "I" or passive voice
- Name people explicitly: "unblocked Mehul on STG104" not "unblocked dependency"
- Skip calendar/admin entries unless they produce an artifact or decision
- Include cross-team deliverables even if small — they signal coordination
- Max 120 words total
- Blockers: surface as explicit items, not buried in body text
- No corporate speak: "drove alignment" → "agreed on X with Y"

**Sub-commands:**
- `work standup` — default box-format output
- `work standup teams` — plain text (no box drawing), Teams chat paste-ready

- Phase: Active (Phase 1 — prompt-routed; Phase 2 — thin `cmd_standup()` dispatch in `work_reader.py`)

---

## `/work plan` — Weekly Planning Command (FR-32.3)

Generates a 3-I-filtered weekly plan from open items and goals. Saves to `state/work/work-weekly-plan.md` on confirmation.

**Natural language triggers:** "plan my week", "what should I focus on this week", "weekly planning", "set up this week", "what's my plan for the week", "work plan"

**Input sources:**
1. `state/work/work-open-items.md` — Critical + Active This Week sections
2. `state/work/reflect-current.md` — current week, active programs
3. `state/work/work-goals.md` — active goals and OKRs
4. `state/work/work-summary.md` — active programs, Sev-2 IcMs

**3-I Filter:** Each candidate item scored: Important (serves active goal?) + Impactful (moves the needle for stakeholders?) + Irreversible (cost of delay?). Score ≥ 2/3 → Focus Outcome. Score 1/3 → Background. Score 0/3 → Won't Do. Any active Sev-2+ IcM auto-qualifies regardless of score.

**Output format:**
```
━━ WEEK PLAN — [Week of DATE] ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Current week: [W-NN] | Active programs: [list]

🎯 FOCUS OUTCOMES (≤4, 3-I ≥ 2/3)

**Input sources:**
1. `state/work/work-accomplishments.md` — since last 1:1 (default: last 7 days)
2. `state/work/work-open-items.md` — active WOIs with urgency flag
3. `state/work/work-weekly-plan.md` — Focus Outcomes and Asks for current week
4. `state/work/people/<alias>.md` — relationship card (if [person] specified and card exists)

Manages the active job search campaign: evaluates job descriptions, tracks the application pipeline, generates tailored CV PDFs, and seeds interview prep. Requires `state/career_search.md` and `~/.artha-local/cv.md` (outside repo — never committed).

Natural language triggers: "career eval", "evaluate this JD", "career tracker", "what's my pipeline", "generate CV", "career pdf".

**Active when:** A goal with `category: career` and `status: active` exists in `state/goals.md`.

### `/career eval <URL|JD text>` — Evaluate a Job Description

Full A–G evaluation of a job posting against the campaign profile and CV.

**Flow:**
1. JD ingestion: navigate URL via browser or accept pasted text
2. JD content validation: verify it's a real JD (not auth wall / login page)
3. Packet extraction: `job_packet` (from JD) + `candidate_packet` (from `~/.artha-local/cv.md`) + `context_packet` (from immigration / finance state)
4. Pre-evaluation confirmation gate: "Ready to evaluate: {title} @ {company} ({location}) — Proceed? [Y/n]"
5. Pre-screen: hard dealbreaker check (sponsorship) + location mismatch flag
6. A–G block evaluation per `prompts/career_search.md`
7. Write report to `briefings/career/{NNN}-{company}-{date}.md`
8. Append tracker row to `state/career_search.md` Applications table
9. Propose PDF generation (auto-proposed if score ≥ 4.0)

**Evaluation blocks:**
- **A** — Archetype Classification: detect primary archetype(s) from JD signals
- **B** — CV Match: requirement-to-CV mapping with gap analysis
- **C** — Compensation Assessment: stated vs. comp_floor; total comp estimate
- **D** — Culture & Team Fit: leadership signals, eng culture, growth environment
- **E** — Personalization Plan: per-JD CV and cover letter customization strategy
- **F** — Interview Prep: STAR story bank entries relevant to this role
- **G** — Composite Score & Recommendation: weighted 6-dimension score (1–5)

**Scoring dimensions (weights from `state/career_search.md`):**
- CV Match: 0.30 · North Star: 0.20 · Compensation: 0.15 · Culture: 0.15 · Level Fit: 0.10 · Red Flags: 0.10

**Output:**
```
━━ Evaluation: Senior AI PM @ Anthropic ━━━━━━
Archetype: Technical AI PM (Primary) · Agentic/Automation (Secondary)
Score: 4.2/5 · Recommendation: ✅ Apply
B CV Match:      4/5  Strong PRD + platform alignment
C Compensation:  4/5  Estimated $380K–$450K TC (above floor)
D Culture:       4/5  Research-first; written communication emphasis
E North Star:    5/5  AI native, frontier model context
F Level Fit:     4/5  Principal-equivalent; verify IC vs management track
G Red Flags:     4/5  Sponsorship: likely (Anthropic history); confirm

### `/career tracker` — Application Pipeline View

Reconciles `state/career_search.md` frontmatter summary block and renders the Applications table with status counts.

**Output:**
```
━━ Career Pipeline ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Status counts:  Evaluated: N · Applied: N · Interview: N · Offer: N
Average score:  N.N/5 (over evaluated + applied)
Velocity:       N apps/week (target: 3/week)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
# | Date | Company | Role | Score | Status | PDF
[table rows]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### `/career pdf <NNN>` — Generate Tailored CV PDF

Invokes `CareerPdfGenerator` skill for report number NNN.

**Flow:**
1. Read evaluation report (`briefings/career/NNN-*.md`) for Block E personalization plan
2. Read `~/.artha-local/cv.md` for base CV content
3. Read `templates/cv-template.html` for layout (Space Grotesk + DM Sans fonts)
4. Inject JD keywords into CV sections (ATS optimization)
5. Render HTML → PDF via Python Playwright (`page.pdf()`)
6. Save to `output/career/cv-{company-slug}-{date}.pdf`

**Prerequisite:** `playwright install chromium` (one-time; preflight check validates Chromium binary).

### `/career scan` — Portal Scan

Scans configured ATS portals (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever) for new matching listings.
Trigger: manual (`/career scan`) or scheduled via `CareerSearchAgent` (EAR-3). New matches appear in `state/career_search.md` Pipeline section.

Config: `config/career_portals.yaml` (per-company `enabled:` flag). TTL: 72h per portal.

### `/career apply <NNN>` — Record Submission

Transitions tracker row `Evaluated` → `Applied` for report NNN. Records timestamp, portal used, referrer (if any). Auto-closes the matching sponsorship-verify open item when present. Emits `career_apply` trace event.

Usage: `/career apply 001 --portal greenhouse --referrer "R. Smith"` — portal + referrer are optional.

Invocation: `python3 scripts/career_apply.py <NNN> [--portal X] [--referrer "Name"] [--notes "..."]`.

### `/career cover <NNN>` — Generate Cover Letter

Authors a 1-page ATS-safe cover letter for report NNN using the Block E personalization plan + Block B CV-match evidence + proof points from `~/.artha-local/article-digest.md`. Output: `briefings/career/{NNN}-cover-letter.md` plus `output/career/cover-{slug}-{date}.pdf`. Hash-sidecar idempotent — same rendered HTML, no regen.

Invocation (skill):
```python
from skills.career_cover_letter import CareerCoverLetter
CareerCoverLetter(report_number="001").execute()
```

### `/career prep <NNN|company>` — Interview Preparation

Assembles a role-specific prep packet: pulls Block F (STAR stories + red-flag Q counters + case-study framework) from the evaluation report, and attaches the KB sections from `state/interview_prep.md` whose titles overlap with the recommended stories. Output: `briefings/career/{NNN}-interview-prep.md`. Emits `career_prep` trace event.

Invocation: `python3 scripts/career_prep.py <NNN|company-slug>` (e.g. `python3 scripts/career_prep.py 001` or `python3 scripts/career_prep.py netflix`).

### `/career stories` — Story Bank View

Displays indexed Story Bank entries from `state/career_search.md` Story Bank section (sorted by `used_for` frequency — most-leveraged stories first).

### `/career start` — Activate Campaign

Idempotency-guarded: checks `campaign.status` before writing. Sets `status: active` and `started: <today>`.

### `/career pause` — Pause Campaign

Sets `campaign.status: paused`. Career briefing block suppressed during briefings while paused.

### `/career done` — Complete Campaign

Lifecycle state machine: `active` → `completed`. Sets `campaign.status: completed`, records `ended` date.
Re-activation path: `campaign.status: completed` → `/career start` → `status: active` (new `started` date, existing history preserved).
