━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```
**Sprint commands:**
- `/goals sprint new` — create a new sprint (Artha asks: name, linked goal, target, duration 14–90 days; default 30 days)
- `/goals sprint pause [name]` — pause sprint progress tracking
- `/goals sprint close [name]` — mark sprint complete; log outcome to memory.md

### `/domain <name>`

- Last updated timestamp
- All active items (not archived) with status
- Any open alerts for this domain
- Suggested next action (if any)
Valid domain names: immigration, finance, kids, travel, health, home, shopping, goals, calendar, vehicle, estate, insurance, comms

### `/domains`
List all available domains with enable/disable status and a one-line description.

**Display format:**
```
━━ YOUR DOMAINS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ALWAYS ACTIVE (load every catch-up):
  ✅ finance       — Bills, bank accounts, credit cards, investments
  ✅ immigration   — USCIS filings, visa status, passport, travel docs
  ✅ health        — Doctor appointments, prescriptions, insurance
  ✅ calendar      — Appointments, reminders, events, schedules
  ✅ comms         — Important messages, follow-ups
  ✅ goals         — Personal goals, habit tracking, progress

ENABLED (load when relevant emails received):
  ✅ home          — Mortgage/rent, maintenance, utilities
  ✅ employment    — Payroll, HR, benefits
  ...

DISABLED (not active — enable with /domains enable <name>):
  ⬜ kids          — School events, homework, grades
  ⬜ pets          — [household_types: not applicable] Pet health, vaccinations
  ...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
N enabled · M disabled · Run a catch-up after enabling to load domain data.
```

**Sub-commands:**
- `/domains enable <name>` — enable a domain (calls `toggle_domain(name, enabled=True)` in profile_loader.py)
- `/domains disable <name>` — disable a domain (calls `toggle_domain(name, enabled=False)`)
- `/domains info <name>` — show full domain details (sensitivity, required connectors, setup questions)

**Implementation:**
Read domain list from `config/domain_registry.yaml` via `scripts/profile_loader.py::available_domains()`.
Cross-reference with `config/user_profile.yaml::domains` to determine enabled/disabled state.
Filter out `phase_2` domains (show as "Coming soon" in a separate section only if the user explicitly asks).
For `enable` / `disable` sub-commands: call `profile_loader.toggle_domain()`, then confirm change.



### `/cost`
Show current month API cost estimate vs. configured monthly budget (from `user_profile.yaml → budget.monthly_api_budget_usd`). Read from `health-check.md:cost_tracking`. Estimate tokens used × current AI CLI pricing.

### `/health`
System integrity check:
- Verify all files in `config/registry.md` exist on disk
- Verify state file schema versions match prompt expectations
- Test: `vault.py status`, `python scripts/pii_guard.py test` (quiet), Gemini CLI ping, Copilot CLI ping
- Report any drift, missing files, or version mismatches
Display: `✅ N/N checks passed` or itemized failures.

### `/eval`
Run the catch-up evaluation report (`python scripts/eval_runner.py`). Displays performance
trends, accuracy metrics, signal:noise ratio, and data freshness. Flags:
- `/eval` — full report (performance + accuracy + freshness)
- `/eval perf` — performance only (connector/skill/phase timing trends)
- `/eval accuracy` — accuracy only (acceptance rate, signal:noise)
- `/eval freshness` — domain staleness and OAuth health

### `/items`
Display all open action items from `state/open_items.md`. Groups:
```
━━ OPEN ITEMS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔴 OVERDUE (deadline passed)
  OI-NNN [domain] [description] — due [date] ([N days overdue])

🟠 DUE SOON (≤7 days)
  OI-NNN [domain] [description] — due [date]

🟡 UPCOMING
  OI-NNN [domain] [description] — due [date]

🔵 OPEN (no deadline)
  OI-NNN [domain] [description]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[N] open items · [N] synced to Microsoft To Do
```
Also accepts: `/items add [description]` to interactively add a new item (Artha asks: domain, deadline, priority, then appends to `open_items.md` and pushes to To Do if configured).

Markdown: `/items done OI-NNN` marks item done; `/items defer OI-NNN [days]` defers.

### `/items quick`
Show only the 5-Minute task list from `state/memory.md → quick_tasks`. Quick display:
```
━━ ⚡ QUICK TASKS (≤5 min, phone-ready) ━━
• [QT-001] [domain] [description]
• [QT-002] [domain] [description]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[N] quick tasks · updated [time]
```
If `quick_tasks` is empty or not yet populated: "No quick tasks identified — run a catch-up to detect them."

### `/bootstrap` and `/bootstrap <domain>`
Guided interview to systematically populate state files. Replaces empty/bootstrap placeholder data with real user-provided information.

**Usage:**
- `/bootstrap` — show all domains with population status, then select one to populate
- `/bootstrap <domain>` — jump directly to that domain's interview
- `/bootstrap quick` — rapid setup mode: collect only the 3–5 highest-priority fields per domain
- `/bootstrap validate` — re-run validation on all existing state files; report field gaps, format errors, and stale data without modifying anything
- `/bootstrap integration` — guided setup for a new data integration (Gmail, Calendar, Outlook, iCloud)

**Workflow:**
```
1. If no domain specified, display population status table:
   ━━ BOOTSTRAP STATUS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Domain          Status           Action
   immigration     ⚠ placeholder    /bootstrap immigration
   finance         ⚠ placeholder    /bootstrap finance
   kids            ✅ populated     —
   health          ⚠ placeholder    /bootstrap health
   ...
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. For selected domain:
   a. Read state file schema from prompts/<domain>.md
   b. Derive interview questions from schema fields
   c. Ask ONE question at a time — never dump a form
   d. Validate input:
      - Dates: must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
      - Amounts: must be numeric
      - Required enum fields: offer valid options
   e. For sensitive fields (SSN, case numbers, account numbers):
      "This field is stored encrypted at rest. Enter your value:"
      Apply Layer 2 semantic redaction before writing
   f. After each domain section, confirm:
      "Here's what I'll save for [section]. Correct? [yes / edit / skip]"

3. Progress tracking:
   - Save progress per domain in memory.md → context_carryover
   - User can exit mid-interview: "Saved progress — resume with /bootstrap <domain>"
   - Already-answered fields preserved on resume

4. After writing:
   a. Run Layer 2 post-write verification (Step 8c)
   b. Update frontmatter: updated_by: user_interview (replaces 'bootstrap')
   c. Update last_updated timestamp
   d. Show completion summary:
      "✅ [domain].md populated: [N] fields written, verification passed"
   e. If domain is encrypted: vault.py decrypt → write → verify → vault.py encrypt

5. Detection rules for population status:
   - `updated_by: bootstrap` → ⚠ placeholder
   - `updated_by: user_interview` or `updated_by: artha-catchup` with >5 populated fields → ✅ populated
   - File missing → ❌ missing
```

**`/bootstrap quick` — Rapid setup mode:**
```
Ask only the 3–5 highest-priority fields per domain (marked `priority: high` in each prompt schema).
Skip optional / enrichment fields entirely.
Suitable for first-run users who want to get started in under 10 minutes.
After completing all high-priority fields, summarize:
  "✅ Quick setup complete. You can deepen any domain with /bootstrap <domain>."
```

**`/bootstrap validate` — Validation-only mode:**
```
For each populated state file:
  1. Check required fields are present and non-empty
  2. Validate date formats (ISO 8601)
  3. Validate numeric fields (no units embedded in numeric values)
  4. Check for stale data (last_updated older than 180 days)
  5. Scan for residual bootstrap placeholders (e.g. "[TBD]", "placeholder")
  6. Run PII guard sanity check (no raw PII in encrypted-at-rest fields)
Output a report card — do NOT modify any files.
  ━━ VALIDATION REPORT ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Domain         Result   Issues
  immigration    ✅ OK    —
  finance        ⚠ stale  last_updated 210 days ago
  health         ❌ gaps  3 required fields missing
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**`/bootstrap integration` — Add a new data integration:**
```
Present a menu of available integrations:
  1. Gmail / Google Calendar  (setup_google_oauth.py)
  2. Outlook / Microsoft To Do / Teams  (setup_msgraph_oauth.py)
  3. iCloud Mail / Calendar  (setup_icloud_auth.py)
  4. Canvas LMS  (canvas_fetch.py)
  5. Apple Health  (parse_apple_health.py)
Guide user through the selected setup script with step-by-step prompts.
After completion, run the corresponding --health check and report status.
```

### `/dashboard`
